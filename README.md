The digital revolution and especially the development of the personal computer
was all about enabling users by giving us a computer on our desk.  I have
found the last few years distribuing as people migrated to online commercial
driven enterprises to managage email (yahoo mail, gmail, hotmail), our
files (dropbox, box), and social (facebook, twitter).  Admittledy I have used
the services above especially gmail but the advent of advertisments following
me around the web based on what is in my gmail account has become the final
straw.  Besides I am a Computer Scientist so shouldn't I manage my own
email, blog, and file syncing service?  As a self proclaimed geek I need to 
stop being lazy.  While these services mentioned above are convienent each user
pays a price in privacy and control.  Computer hardware has never been cheaper
especially with products like the Raspberry PI ($35).  Sure you have to add
a power supply ($5) and flash card ($25), for a total one time cost of $65.  
Then each year I recommend a domain name ($15) and a official SSL certificate
($9.99).  The first year of operation will cost $7.49 a month while additioanl
years of operation will cost $2.08 a month.  A small price to pay for your
digital freedom.  In addition reading this guide and learning how email, blog,
and other services work is eductional and fun.
