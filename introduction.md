# Introduction

The digital revolution and especially the development of the personal computer
was all about enabling users by giving us a computer on our desk.  I have
found the last few years disturbing as people migrated to on-line commercial
driven enterprises to manage email (yahoo mail, gmail, hotmail), our
files (dropbox, box), and social (facebook, twitter).  Admittedly I have used
the services above especially gmail but the advent of advertisements following
me around the web based on what is in my gmail account has become the final
straw.  Besides I am a Computer Scientist so shouldn't I manage my own
email, blog, and file syncing service?  As a self proclaimed geek I need to 
stop being lazy.  While these services mentioned above are convenient each user
pays a price in privacy and control.  Computer hardware has never been cheaper
especially with products like the Raspberry PI ($35).  Sure you have to add
a power supply ($5) and flash card ($25), for a total one time cost of $65.  
Then each year I recommend a domain name ($15) and a official SSL certificate
($9.99).  The first year of operation will cost $7.49 a month while additional
years of operation will cost $2.08 a month.  A small price to pay for your
digital freedom.  In addition reading this guide and learning how email, blog,
and other services work is educational and fun.  

## Rules of Engagement

This guide will refer you to other sources of documentation especially hardware
and network setup.  As time permits I may add suggestions on hardware and
network setup.
